# Simple Digital Clock

- do date --help so see all the flags you can use with date to get what you want
- print out the current time every 1 second

tip:
  - use infinite while loop to print the time out
  - you can do +%T to get the hr:min:sec
  - you can use %H hr, %M minute, %S second and then arrange them the way you like
    - eg: "%H:%M:%S", or "%H-%M-%S" or "%H - %M - %S"
