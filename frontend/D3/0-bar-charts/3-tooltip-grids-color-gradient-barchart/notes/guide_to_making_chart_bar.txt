This is a rough guide to creating a Bar Chart, you should be familiar with how D3 works before using this guide

1. Create your BarChart react component and return your svg element
  - your component should receive 3 arguments
    1. data, something like below:
      const sampleData = [
        { name: "A", value: 30 },
        { name: "B", value: 80 },
        { name: "C", value: 45 },
        { name: "D", value: 60 },
        { name: "E", value: 20 }
      ];
    2. width (i.e the width for your chart)
    3. height (i.e the height for your chart)
  - let the svg element be responsive - {you can look at the sample code, no need to memorize}
  - Add your svg ref and container ref
  - bring in your useEffect hook and let the magic begin

2. Select the svg element and remove all previous renders

3. work on the margins and use it to calculate the chartWidth and chartHeight

4. using the chartWidth, create your xScale
5. using the chartHeight, create your yScale

6. append the tooltip element to the container, add a "class" with value "tooltip-card"
  - add a style: make the opacity: 0

7. create the "gradient defs" in the svg {you can look at the sample code, no need to memorize}
   - let the "linearGradient" have an id of "bar-gradient" and let the direction be from "top to bottom"
   -
   - create another gradient with id: "bar-gradient2", from: left to right
   - create another gradient with id: "bar-gradient3", from: top-left to bottom-right

8. Start work on the chart, create a "group" element for the chart
  - move the <g> element: on the x-axis, use margin.left, on the y-axis, use margin.top
  {we moved the <g> group element to match with our chartWidth & chartHeight}
  - Read: i asked grok a question:
    can i replace .attr with .style("transform", `translate(${margin.left},${margin.top})`);? will i get the same result?

9. Optional: Add grid-lines to the chart
  - tip, add a new group for the x-grid-lines and the y-grid-lines
  - for the x-axis, use y-axis ticks
  - for the y-axis, use x-axis ticks

10. Create your bars using "rect" element
  - bind data to the rect
  - create new rect, if enough rect do not exist
  - work on the x, y, width and height of each rect
  - fill the bar with the "gradient defs" we created
  - add event listeners to show/hide the tooltip for each bar
    - when we: mouse-enter
      - show the tooltip, show a custom message, move the tooltip to wherever the mouse is
      - change the fill color of the rectangle to "orange"
    - mouse-move
      - continue to move the tooltip to the position of the mouse
    - mouse-leave
      - hide the tooltip
      - return the fill color back to the gradient we created
  - using transition animate the y-position and the height of the bars
  - use delay and easing for the transition above

11. Create the x-axis and y-axis with their labels
