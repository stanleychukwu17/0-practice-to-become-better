This is a rough guide to creating your BarChart, you should at-least be familiar with D3 and it's methods

1. Create your BarChart component and your svg element
  - let the svg element be responsive - {you can look at code, no need to memorize}

2. Add your svg ref and container ref
  - next, you need a useEffect

3. Select the svg element and remove all previous renders

4. work on the margins and use it to calculate the chartWidth and chartHeight

5. using the chartWidth, create your xScale
6. using the chartHeight, create your yScale

7. append the tooltip element to the container, add a "class" with value "tooltip-card"

8. create the "gradient defs" in the svg {you can look at code, no need to memorize}

9. Start work on the chart, create a "group" element for the chart

10. Optional: Add grid-lines to the chart
  - for the x-axis, use y-axis ticks
  - for the y-axis, use x-axis ticks

11. Create your bars using "rect" element
  - bind data to the rect
  - create new rect, if enough rect do not exist
  - fill the bar with the gradient created
  - add event listeners to show/hide the tooltip for each bar
    - mouse-enter, mouse-move, mouse-leave
  - using transition animate the y-position and the height of the bars

12. Create the x-axis and y-axis with their labels
