1. start the server: pnpm/npm dev

2. the code is located in the src/components/BarChart/BarChart1.tsx

    - carry on with your animating the bars

3. test that everything works fine
    - commit all changes made to github

5. clean up
    - take the code in BarChart1.tsx back to Default.tsx
    - delete App1.tsx, BarChart1.tsx, node_modules
    - commit all changes after clean up
