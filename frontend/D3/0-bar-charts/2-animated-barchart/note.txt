# Animating in D3
in order to animate, we do:
  d3.select(selector)
    .transition()
    .duration(<milliseconds>)
    .delay( (data, index) => index * <amount_to_delay_in_milliseconds> )

Now any property or attr that is called after the ".transition.duration.delay" will be animated.

In this project, we animated the:
  .attr("y") :: from "chartHeight" -> (d) => yScale(d.value)
  .attr("height") :: from "0" -> (d) => chartHeight - yScale(d.value)
